This a modified version of EES4100_Example_Code 
It was altered for running a modbus client program and called modbus_client
The application accesses a Modbus server and takes data from two registers and print the register being read.
Additional changes to provide usable remote server IP address and modbus register numbers (2) at 44 & 45

The code was further modified to link to an Autotools version of the BACnet stack, called libbacnet.
Not sure I have added the "relevant variables" yet.

Made modifications to bacnet_server so that it can run a modbus thread and function as a client for the modbus server as well as the server to the Bacnet client.

Altered some names, and eliminated small errors.
Program was run using loopback IP succesfully.

Changed the server IP address to test UDP functionality and renamed the source file to EES4100_Bridge.c
