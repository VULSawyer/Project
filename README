This a modified version of EES4100_Example_Code 
It was altered for running a modbus client program and called modbus_client
The application accesses a Modbus server and takes data from two registers and print the register being read.


Additional changes to provide usable remote server IP address and modbus register numbers (2) at 44 & 45

The code was further modified to link to an Autotools version of the BACnet stack, called libbacnet.
Not sure I have added the "relevant variables" yet.
